# ATM
I built this project in C++ and it is a simulated ATM Machine. This program is simple but was interesting to create because it was my introduction to C++. The program begins by showing the user a list of options to select: 
1.	Sign in
2.	Balance
3.	Deposit
4.	Withdraw
5.	Exit

It uses arrays to store clientâ€™s account balances. Each client starts with an account balance of $1,000 and the program will update the clients account balance depending on how much they deposit/withdrawal.  The user is also able to Exit and view their current balance. Below are screenshots of me running the program. I attempted to simulate someone trying to login to an incorrect account and also withdrawing too much money than they have available as well.
